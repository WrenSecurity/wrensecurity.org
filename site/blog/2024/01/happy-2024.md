The past year's efforts were mainly focused on the Access Management tools. Both [Wren:DS](https://wrensecurity.org/projects/wrends/) and [Wren:AM](https://wrensecurity.org/projects/wrenam/) have undergone significant upgrades and security hardening to meet the standards earlier set by [Wren:IDM](https://wrensecurity.org/projects/wrenidm/). This means that the key components are now independent of the legacy infrastructure and have also been polished to ensure the high level of security and robustness. This progress paved the way for the introduction of new features, such as Cisco Duo authentication module.

On top of that there was regular maintenance and improvements in the development infrastructure, e.g. cleanup of the UI libraries.
To highlight our dedication to delivering dependable software, we have become a CVE numbering authority in the [CVE.org](http://cve.org/) Program, allowing us to transparently manage and share potential security vulnerabilities (see [Disclosure Policy](https://wrensecurity.org/community/disclosure.html)). The importance of maintaining an active online presence led us to create an X (Twitter) account providing a more convenient way to share updates. [Follow us](https://twitter.com/WrenSecurity) to keep up with the latest news.

## Plans and Wishes for 2024

Looking ahead to 2024, our goal remains to get rid of the legacy heritage. We will soon release an upgraded and independent version of Wren:IG. After that, we will continue with the [Wren:ICF](https://wrensecurity.org/projects/wrenicf/) framework components to ensure a seamless interplay with the rest of the platform.

Addressing the unfinished redesign of the Wren:AM administration interface is a priority, as it contributes significantly to our credibility. We'll focus on rewriting the remaining pages to enhance user experience.

For the same reasons, we will continue to fill the gaps in the documentation and create basic guides to help users get started.

What else? We'd like to keep up with the trends and go passwordless. So, we will start digging into the integration of [FIDO standards](https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/).

We aspire to improve the clarity of our development roadmap. This involves open planning of releases on GitHub allowing our community to easily track progress through our backlog.

## Conclusion

As we wrap up 2023, let's look at the year in numbers:

* 267 commits;
* 130 000+ insertions and 120 000+ deletions in 4200+ files;
* 112 merged pull requests;
* 36 closed issues;
* 28 new releases and 35 tags;
* 285 dependabot issues fixed.

We are determined to maintain the same pace in 2024 and deepen our footprint in the open-source identity and access management field.

Happy new year!
