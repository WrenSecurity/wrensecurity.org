We have created a brand new website for Wren Security security suite.

Our former website (built using WordPress) was not easy to update and expand. It was
created as more of a leaflet to define our presence and look and feel for the Wren Security
brand. It served its purpose, but it was time to move on.

The new website has dedicated sections for top-level projects (Wren:IDM, Wren:AM, Wren:DS
and Wren:ICF), instructions on community involvement and dedicated section for blog
posts (various project related news).

New website is built and run using the following technologies:

* [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Source code of the website is hosted in [wrensec-website](https://github.com/WrenSecurity/wrensec-website)
GitHub repository. Pull requests are welcome. :100:
