We have prepared recipes (samples) demonstrating key Wren:IDM features.
From now it is possible to try Wren:IDM easily.

We have prepared following samples:

* sync :gear: – synchronize data between Wren:IDM and source / target systems
* workflow :memo: – create workflow with approval in Wren:IDM
* roles :closed_lock_with_key: – manage roles and assignment values
* endpoint :ballot_box: – create custom REST API endpoint to execute custom business logic
* scheduler :stopwatch: – schedule synchronization or script to be automatically triggered
* email :email: – send email notification

Environment for each sample is defined through *Docker Compose* file.
You need just one command to start relevant *Docker* containers, zero configuration needed.

Samples are hosted in [wrenidm-cookbook](https://github.com/WrenSecurity/wrenidm-cookbook)
GitHub repository.
