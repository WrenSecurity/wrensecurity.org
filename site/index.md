::: tip Project Origin

Though our project originated with code that ForgeRock™ had previously released, we are not affiliated with ForgeRock™ in any way. Our projects are based on the very latest code from what was available under a CDDL license (OpenAM 13.5+, OpenDJ 3.5+, OpenIDM 4.5+, and OpenIG 4.0+). ForgeRock™ no longer releases any of the most recent versions of their software under an open-source license. ForgeRock™’s “Community Edition” are ancient versions of the projects. Join our community for the latest and greatest.
