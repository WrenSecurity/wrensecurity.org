# Wren:AM

## Overview

Wren:AM is an "all-in-one" access management solution providing strong and adaptive authentication, authorization, single sign-on (SSO), entitlements, federation and web services security.

Wren:AM provides mobile support out of the box, with full OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) support - modern protocols that
provide the most efficient method for developing secure native or web-based mobile applications optimized for bandwidth and
CPU.

Wren:AM is one of the projects in the Wren Security Suite, a community initiative that adopted open‐source projects
formerly developed by ForgeRock, which has its own roots in Sun Microsystems’ products.


## Acknowledgments

Wren:AM is standing on the shoulders of giants and is a continuation of a prior work:

* OpenSSO by Sun Microsystems
* OpenAM by ForgeRock AS

We'd like to thank them for supporting the idea of open-source software.
