# Wren:IG

## Overview

Wren:IG is a community‐developed reverse proxy server providing single sign-on (SSO) to any application behind the proxy.

Wren:IG includes a number of pre-built filters to transform data of intercepred requests / responses.
Scripted filter allows you to easily create your own filter using the Groovy language.

The features of Wren:IG include:

  * Authentication / Authorization using industry-standard protocols (SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)
  * Single Sign-On (SSO)
  * Single Logout (SLO)
  * Session management
  * Password replay

Wren:IG is one of the projects in the Wren Security Suite, a community initiative that adopted open‐source projects
formerly developed by ForgeRock.
