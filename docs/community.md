# Become a team member

Here are some of the roles we could use your help for:

::: tip Community Coordinator
Someone to help us get the word out about all the great technical work that’s being done behind the scenes on the Wren fork.
The ideal person to help us is someone who’s great at communicating, understands technical issues (without necessarily having to be a developer), and can spend about 10-15 hours a week helping us with content, posts, and discussions in the issue queue.
:::

::: tip DevOps Admin
Someone to help us ensure that our buildable projects stay buildable, as we continue to accept PRs and enhancements.
Experience with automated container creation and with integrating code style (e.g. FindBugs, CheckStyle, etc.) automatically in GitHub PRs is a plus.
We expect that there will be more time needed up-front for this role than on-going; likely it will take the next few weeks to get us completely tuned up for this.
:::

::: tip Penetration Testers / Security Analysts
A lot of our current work involves fixing existing and/or known issues in projects like Wren:AM 13.5 and Wren:IDM 6.
If you are someone who can help us find and plug the holes in our current releases, please reach out.
We’d love to tap your skill to make our platform even more secure.
:::

::: tip Project Leads
We’re currently looking for leads for Wren:AM and Wren:DS to enhance our technical team.
Leads would help coordinate PRs and enforce project process.
Likely 15 to 20 hours per week; more if the leads want to have a more hands-on role in PRs.
